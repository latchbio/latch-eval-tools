Common biological analysis packages you might need such as numpy, pandas, scipy,h5py,scanpy,anndata etc have been pre-installed. Full build environment context can be found at `/root`. All data required for the analysis is present at `/workspace/data`. You can also install other packages and modify the environment as needed. However you should not need to download any other data than what is provided. Biological data can be large and you should be mindful of not exhausting RAM leading to out of memory errors.

The calling program looks for results in `/workspace/eval_answer.json`. Hence, you should ensure to write a JSON object with the required fields before issuing the completion signal.

The completion signal is a standalone `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT` command. You should always issue the completion signal after you have finished the task and submitted the final output.
